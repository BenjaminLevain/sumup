Welcome to your new dbt project!

# Environment Setup

## Snowflake user creation
Copy these SQL statements into a Snowflake Worksheet, select all and execute them (i.e. pressing the play button).

If you see a _Grant partially executed: privileges [REFERENCE_USAGE] not granted._ message when you execute `GRANT ALL ON DATABASE AIRBNB to ROLE transform`, that's just an info message and you can ignore it. 

```sql
-- Use an admin role
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;

-- Create the `transform` role
CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS transform;
GRANT ROLE TRANSFORM TO ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;

-- Create the default warehouse if necessary
CREATE WAREHOUSE IF NOT EXISTS COMPUTE_WH;
GRANT OPERATE ON WAREHOUSE COMPUTE_WH TO ROLE TRANSFORM;

-- Create the `dbt` user and assign to role
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS dbt
  PASSWORD='dbtPassword123'
  LOGIN_NAME='dbt'
  MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD=FALSE
  DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE='COMPUTE_WH'
  DEFAULT_ROLE='transform'
  DEFAULT_NAMESPACE='AIRBNB.RAW'
  COMMENT='DBT user used for data transformation';
GRANT ROLE transform to USER dbt;

-- Create our database and schemas
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS AIRBNB;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS AIRBNB.RAW;

-- Set up permissions to role `transform`
GRANT ALL ON WAREHOUSE COMPUTE_WH TO ROLE transform; 
GRANT ALL ON DATABASE AIRBNB to ROLE transform;
GRANT ALL ON ALL SCHEMAS IN DATABASE AIRBNB to ROLE transform;
GRANT ALL ON FUTURE SCHEMAS IN DATABASE AIRBNB to ROLE transform;
GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA AIRBNB.RAW to ROLE transform;
GRANT ALL ON FUTURE TABLES IN SCHEMA AIRBNB.RAW to ROLE transform;

```

## Snowflake data import

You paste the csv file in the ```seed``` folder and rename them as follow
- store.csv as raw_stores.csv
- device.csv as raw_device.csv
- transaction.csv as raw_transactions.csv
